# Blinkit Sales Analysis with Power BI

This project is focused on conducting a comprehensive data analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. Using Power BI, a dashboard was developed to visualize key metrics and insights that could guide decision-making and optimize business strategies. The project involves analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average sales, number of items sold, customer ratings, and other factors influencing Blinkit's performance.


## Objective
- To analyze Blinkit's sales data, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution.
- To uncover insights and opportunities for optimization.
- To create an interactive dashboard using Power BI that visualizes key metrics such as sales, customer ratings, and item performance across different outlets.
## Business Requirements
The main goals of the analysis were:

- Total Sales: Track overall revenue generated from sold items.
- Average Sales: Determine the average revenue per sale.
- Number of Items Sold: Calculate the total count of items sold.
- Customer Ratings: Measure customer satisfaction based on the average rating of items sold.
These KPIs were visualized in different charts to help Blinkit optimize their business processes.
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs were central to the analysis:

- Total Sales: Total revenue generated from sold items.
- Average Sales: Average revenue per sale.
- Number of Items Sold: Total number of unique items sold.
- Average Rating: Customer satisfaction score based on ratings for sold items.
## Visualization

The dashboard includes a variety of charts and visualizations to track performance:

- Total Sales by Fat Content: Assesses the impact of fat content on sales (Donut Chart). Also examines how KPIs like average sales and number of items sold vary with fat content.

- Total Sales by Item Type: Evaluates the performance of different item types (Bar Chart).

- Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales: Compares sales across outlets segmented by fat content (Stacked Column Chart).

- Total Sales by Outlet Establishment: Analyzes how the age or type of outlet affects sales (Line Chart).

- Sales by Outlet Size: Correlates outlet size with sales performance (Donut/Pie Chart).

- Sales by Outlet Location: Visualizes the geographic distribution of sales (Funnel Map).

- All Metrics by Outlet Type: Provides a comprehensive view of all metrics (sales, average sales, number of items, average rating) by outlet type (Matrix Card).
## Power BI Features Used
- DAX Calculations: Custom calculations for KPIs like total sales, average sales, and customer satisfaction.
- Charts: Donut, Bar, Stacked Column, Line, Pie, Funnel, and Matrix visuals were used to represent the data.
- Filters and Slicers: Enabled filtering by multiple criteria such as outlet type, location, and fat content.
